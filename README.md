## *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* analysis of intron splicing

The scripts are run via R Markdown to generate pdf reports.\
The scripts do minor quality control and compare subsets of intron containing genes within and between experimental conditions.\
The experimental condition, and two-batch correction, are currently hard coded into the scripts.\
Hence, at this time the pipeline would require a substantial rewrite to be generalized.

### The following folders and files need to be created or made available.

-   /InFiles/CountFiles/ BAM-files

-   /Infiles/IntronGenes.csv List of intron genes of interest.

-   /Infiles/Cluster.csv For batch correction for two batches.

-   /InOutFiles Holds files generated by one and used by another script.

-   /OutFiles Holds the generated pdf reports.

-   /Outcsv Holds generated csv files.

-   /Outpng Holds generated image files.
